# Propagation on a single ring
All GIFs in this sections are of the same form. On the left one can see the probability density of the initial wave function in position space. The blue, dotted line shows the expm method's propagation and the read line the Chebyshev propagation. On the right, the magnitude of the difference of both solutions is shown.
