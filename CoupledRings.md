# Coupled Josephson rings
For every example on the coupled rings, there will be a propagation of the porbability density in position space and below that the propagation in momentum space. If the lines in the figures are blue, the rings are decoupled. If they turn red, the coupling swiched on. The vertical black line in the position space propagation marks the position of the junction. To its left is ring A and on the right hand side is ring B.

## Single coupled rings 

### Initial wave function: plane wave, that starts on ring A
